                        <div> 
                            With our project we aim to create a perfect school building in terms of student’s quality of life, accessibility and comfort. In order to reach that goal we prepared a custom structure and layout with the student’s best interest in mind.

                            <div> With the hexagonal build of the school we aim to cater towards the ease of movement between classrooms. The rooms being distributed in a spherical manner assures the least amount of distance needed to be traveled for your next lesson.  </div>

                            <div> Both in order to minimize required stair usage as well as make the school wheelchair accessible we decided to make the building have two floors aside from the bottom level.  </div>

                            <div> With the classrooms being placed at the outer and inner edges of the hexagon as well as low floor count, all necessary rooms are well lit and have great access to windows and natural light. Think of it like a donut, with a hole in the middle. </div>
