                            The theme of this technical educational project, the first stage of which took place in Poznań, is <span>School of the future </span>. The basic assumption of the project is that students of both schools will jointly develop their technical knowledge in the broadly understood field of computer science and programming to create a school of the future using the <a href="https://designthinking.pl/co-to-jest-design-thinking/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline"> Design Thinking method.</a>
                        </div>
                    <!--2nd block-->
                        <div> Students participating in this project work on ideas and solutions that could improve learning and everyday life in schools in the future. In addition to technical classes, students will also learn about the culture and history of both regions, as the project will end with an exchange in Solingen in March. </div>

                            In the initial phase of work, each group discussed the profile of the persona in the school environment along with their needs, and then define the various problems they struggle with daily. In the next stage of activities, after discussing  the needs and problems of the personas, each group narrowed their choice to one issue they wanted to work on, looking for ideas to solve the problem they chose, using brainstorming and showing other groups their thought process. During the group's work, they were asked occasionally to give each other feedback, which was a great added value for each participant.

                        <div> 
                            The next stage was to create a visualization of the prototype of their solution using e.g. plasticine, plastic sticks, pieces of paper and fabric, where the students showed great creativity. In the last phase of design work during the exchange in Poznan, students in each group, after assigning specific tasks, were already working on their prototypes, which over time will turn into working ones as the groups are obliged to continue working on them after the end of the first exchange. And products will be shown in Solingen.

                            Individual groups work on such products, e.g.: a model of the school of the future, websites, an application for exchanging information between students and teachers.

                            Using tools such as Fusion 360, Blender, Visual studio code.

                            Apart from work, the days were also spent learning about the culture and history of our region and Poland. For this purpose, everyone visited three places in the city.
