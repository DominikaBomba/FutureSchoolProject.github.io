The theme of this technical educational project, the first stage of which took place in Poznań, is "School of the future". The basic assumption of the project is that students of both schools will jointly develop their technical knowledge in the broadly understood field of computer science and programming to create a school of the future using the Design Thinking method https://designthinking.pl/co-to-jest-design-thinking/
                        </div> 
<div> Students participating in this project work on ideas and solutions that could improve learning and everyday life in schools in the future. In addition to technical classes, students will also learn about the culture and history of both regions, as the project will end with an exchange in Solingen in March 2024. </div>

Twenty students (6 girls!) have worked and will work in 5 teams, randomly selected and mixed by nationality (two people from a Polish and a German school), and each member of the group is somehow forced to leave their "comfort zone" because cooperates with three people he did not know before, which is supposed to reflect the working conditions in the sample company in the future, and communication in groups took place primarily in English, which is also common in the world of work.

The guests from Germany together with their guardians Mr. Julian Jacob, Mr. Malte Ernst, and Mr. Anja Fischer arrived by train on Sunday afternoon and were welcomed by a group of students from our school together with the coordinators Mr. Sebastian Kubica and Mr. Agata Wojcieszak. The very next morning after their arrival, they appeared at our school, where they were officially welcomed by principal Ryszard Pyssa. Then, German students were introduced to its specificity by visiting the ZSK building at ul. Fredry. German youth participated in lessons with their Polish peers, which allowed them to get to know our school better. Of course, the guests also visited the school's model shop and admired the railway models.

After getting to know the school, group activities began. Experienced project coordinators from Germany very efficiently guided the students through the individual stages of work using the Design Thinking method, which is used in many business entities and is used to find solutions to non-obvious problems.

In the initial phase of work, each group discussed the profile of the so-called persona in the school environment along with their needs, and then define the various problems they struggle with daily. In the next stage of activities, after discussing the multi-aspect nature of the needs and problems of the above-mentioned personas, each group narrowed their choice to one issue they wanted to work on, looking for ideas to solve the problem they chose, using brainstorming and showing other groups their thought process. During the group's work, they were asked occasionally to give each other feedback, which was a great added value for each participant.

The next stage was to create a visualization of the prototype of their "solution" using e.g. plasticine, plastic sticks, pieces of paper and fabric, where the students showed great creativity. In the last phase of design work during the exchange in Poznań, students in each group, after assigning specific tasks, were already working on their prototypes, which over time (the groups are obliged to continue working on them after the end of the first exchange) will turn into working ones. products and will be shown in Solingen.

Individual groups work on such products, e.g.: a model of the school of the future, websites, an application for exchanging information between students and teachers.

Using tools such as Fusion 360, Blender, Visual studio code.

Apart from work, the days were also spent learning about the culture and history of our region and Poland. For this purpose, everyone visited three places in the city.
